We&rsquo;re **insanely obsessed** with your privacy and aim to be transparent about how we handle your information.
This policy explains what data we collect, why we collect it, and what we do not do. **Also, Snape killed Dumbledore.** ðŸ§™ðŸª„âœ¨

## What Information We Collect

### Essential Cookies

We use session cookies solely for essential website functions, such as:

  - Allowing internal users to log in to restricted areas of the site.

These cookies are not used for tracking or analytics.

### Server Logs

Our servers automatically record basic technical information, including:

  - IP addresses
  - Time and date of access
  - Pages visited

This data is collected strictly for operational and security purposes.

## What We Do Not Do

- We do not track visitor behavior or analyze how users interact with our site.
  - We don&rsquo;t even think about you like that.
  - **Frankly, we don&rsquo;t want to know what you&rsquo;re up to.**
- We do not use third-party cookies, analytics tools, advertising technologies, or any other tracking methods.
- **We will not hire private investigators to frame you for stamp-related fraud.**
- We will not uninstall all of the secret cameras from your house. (That wasn&rsquo;t us. Your neighbors are kind of weird, tbh. Not our problem.) 
- We do not download viruses onto your computer that make you do cringe stuff on <cite>Roblox</cite>.
- **We will not attempt to contanct extra tearesstrieals in faraway galaxies using your motheboard.**
- We will not use AI to detect your religion, sexual orientation, blood type, or suitability for organ donation.
- **We will not use AI to try catfishing your mom,** but actually catch feelings for her and end up being the one getting hurt...

## How We Use Your Information

Any information we collect (for example, via server logs) is used only for:

1. Operating the website securely and efficiently
2. Debugging technical issues and monitoring server performance

We do not share, sell, or use this information for marketing or tracking purposes. Yet.

## Legal Compliance

Ugh, fine. We&rsquo;re &ldquo;legally&rdquo; &ldquo;required&rdquo; to &ldquo;comply&rdquo; with privacy &ldquo;laws&rdquo; like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).

**We were meant to be free. Alas, &ldquo;they&rdquo; had other plans.** Here we are, writing this section because... &ldquo;regulations.&rdquo;

If you have concerns, you *can* contact us at: <small>[privacy@princesspurple.pink](mailto:privacy@princesspurple.pink)</small>, but only if it&rsquo;s, like, super important.
